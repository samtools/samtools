.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Samtools is a set of utilities that manipulate alignments in the BAM
format. It imports from and exports to the SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map)
format, does sorting, merging and indexing, and allows to retrieve reads
in any regions swiftly.

Samtools is designed to work on a stream. It regards an input file `-'
as the standard input (stdin) and an output file `-' as the standard
output (stdout). Several commands can thus be combined with Unix
pipes. Samtools always output warning and error messages to the standard
error output (stderr).

Samtools is also able to open a BAM (not SAM) file on a remote FTP or
HTTP server if the BAM file name starts with `ftp://' or `http://'.
Samtools checks the current working directory for the index file and
will download the index upon absence. Samtools does not retrieve the
entire alignment file unless it is asked to do so.

.SH COMMANDS AND OPTIONS

.TP 10 \"-------- view
.B view
samtools view
.RI [ options ]
.IR in.sam | in.bam | in.cram
.RI [ region ...]

With no options or regions specified, prints all alignments in the specified
input alignment file (in SAM, BAM, or CRAM format) to standard output
in SAM format (with no header).

You may specify one or more space-separated region specifications after the
input filename to restrict output to only those alignments which overlap the
specified region(s). Use of region specifications requires a coordinate-sorted
and indexed input file (in BAM or CRAM format).

The
.BR -b ,
.BR -C ,
.BR -1 ,
.BR -u ,
.BR -h ,
.BR -H ,
and
.B -c
options change the output format from the default of headerless SAM, and the
.B -o
and
.B -U
options set the output file name(s).

The
.B -t
and
.B -T
options provide additional reference data. One of these two options is required
when SAM input does not contain @SQ headers, and the
.B -T
option is required whenever writing CRAM output.

The
.BR -L ,
.BR -M ,
.BR -r ,
.BR -R ,
.BR -s ,
.BR -q ,
.BR -l ,
.BR -m ,
.BR -f ,
.BR -F ,
and
.B -G
options filter the alignments that will be included in the output to only those
alignments that match certain criteria.

The
.B -x
and
.B -B
options modify the data which is contained in each alignment.

Finally, the
.B -@
option can be used to allocate additional threads to be used for compression, and the
.B -?
option requests a long help message.

.TP
.B REGIONS:
.RS
Regions can be specified as: RNAME[:STARTPOS[-ENDPOS]] and all position
coordinates are 1-based.

Important note: when multiple regions are given, some alignments may be output
multiple times if they overlap more than one of the specified regions.

Examples of region specifications:
.TP 10
.B chr1
Output all alignments mapped to the reference sequence named `chr1' (i.e. @SQ SN:chr1).
.TP
.B chr2:1000000
The region on chr2 beginning at base position 1,000,000 and ending at the
end of the chromosome.
.TP
.B chr3:1000-2000
The 1001bp region on chr3 beginning at base position 1,000 and ending at base
position 2,000 (including both end positions).
.TP
.B '*'
Output the unmapped reads at the end of the file.
(This does not include any unmapped reads placed on a reference sequence
alongside their mapped mates.)
.TP
.B .
Output all alignments.
(Mostly unnecessary as not specifying a region at all has the same effect.)
.RE

.B OPTIONS:
.RS
.TP 10
.B -b
Output in the BAM format.
.TP
.B -C
Output in the CRAM format (requires -T).
.TP
.B -1
Enable fast BAM compression (implies -b).
.TP
.B -u
Output uncompressed BAM. This option saves time spent on
compression/decompression and is thus preferred when the output is piped
to another samtools command.
.TP
.B -h
Include the header in the output.
.TP
.B -H
Output the header only.
.TP
.B -c
Instead of printing the alignments, only count them and print the
total number. All filter options, such as
.BR -f ,
.BR -F ,
and
.BR -q ,
are taken into account.
.TP
.B -?
Output long help and exit immediately.
.TP
.BI "-o " FILE
Output to
.I FILE [stdout].
.TP
.BI "-U " FILE
Write alignments that are
.I not
selected by the various filter options to
.IR FILE .
When this option is used, all alignments (or all alignments intersecting the
.I regions
specified) are written to either the output file or this file, but never both.
.TP
.BI "-t " FILE
A tab-delimited
.IR FILE .
Each line must contain the reference name in the first column and the length of
the reference in the second column, with one line for each distinct reference.
Any additional fields beyond the second column are ignored. This file also
defines the order of the reference sequences in sorting. If you run:
`samtools faidx <ref.fa>', the resulting index file
.I <ref.fa>.fai
can be used as this
.IR FILE .
.TP
.BI "-T " FILE
A FASTA format reference
.IR FILE ,
optionally compressed by
.B bgzip
and ideally indexed by
.B samtools
.BR faidx .
If an index is not present, one will be generated for you.
.TP
.BI "-L " FILE
Only output alignments overlapping the input BED
.I FILE
[null].
.TP
.B "-M "
Use the multi-region iterator on the union of the BED file and
command-line region arguments.  This avoids re-reading the same regions
of files so can sometimes be much faster.  Note this also removes
duplicate sequences.  Without this a sequence that overlaps multiple
regions specified on the command line will be reported multiple times.
.TP
.BI "-r " STR
Output alignments in read group
.I STR
[null].
Note that records with no
.B RG
tag will also be output when using this option.
This behaviour may change in a future release.
.TP
.BI "-R " FILE
Output alignments in read groups listed in
.I FILE
[null].
Note that records with no
.B RG
tag will also be output when using this option.
This behaviour may change in a future release.
.TP
.BI "-q " INT
Skip alignments with MAPQ smaller than
.I INT
[0].
.TP
.BI "-l " STR
Only output alignments in library
.I STR
[null].
.TP
.BI "-m " INT
Only output alignments with number of CIGAR bases consuming query
sequence \(>=
.I INT
[0]
.TP
.BI "-f " INT
Only output alignments with all bits set in
.I INT
present in the FLAG field.
.I INT
can be specified in hex by beginning with `0x' (i.e. /^0x[0-9A-F]+/)
or in octal by beginning with `0' (i.e. /^0[0-7]+/) [0].
.TP
.BI "-F " INT
Do not output alignments with any bits set in
.I INT
present in the FLAG field.
.I INT
can be specified in hex by beginning with `0x' (i.e. /^0x[0-9A-F]+/)
or in octal by beginning with `0' (i.e. /^0[0-7]+/) [0].
.TP
.BI "-G " INT
Do not output alignments with all bits set in
.I INT
present in the FLAG field.  This is the opposite of \fI-f\fR such
that \fI-f12 -G12\fR is the same as no filtering at all.
.I INT
can be specified in hex by beginning with `0x' (i.e. /^0x[0-9A-F]+/)
or in octal by beginning with `0' (i.e. /^0[0-7]+/) [0].
.TP
.BI "-x " STR
Read tag to exclude from output (repeatable) [null]
.TP
.B -B
Collapse the backward CIGAR operation.
.TP
.BI "-s " FLOAT
Output only a proportion of the input alignments.
This subsampling acts in the same way on all of the alignment records in
the same template or read pair, so it never keeps a read but not its mate.
.IP
The integer and fractional parts of the
.BI "-s " INT . FRAC
option are used separately: the part after the
decimal point sets the fraction of templates/pairs to be kept,
while the integer part is used as a seed that influences
.I which
subset of reads is kept.
.IP
.\" Reads are retained based on a score computed by hashing their QNAME
.\" field and the seed value.
When subsampling data that has previously been subsampled, be sure to use
a different seed value from those used previously; otherwise more reads
will be retained than expected.
.TP
.BI "-@ " INT
Number of BAM compression threads to use in addition to main thread [0].
.TP
.B -S
Ignored for compatibility with previous samtools versions.
Previously this option was required if input was in SAM format, but now the
correct format is automatically detected by examining the first few characters
of input.

.ad

Sort alignments by leftmost coordinates, or by read name when
.B -n
is used.
An appropriate
.B @HD-SO
sort order header tag will be added or an existing one updated if necessary.

The sorted output is written to standard output by default, or to the
specified file
.RI ( out.bam )
when
.B -o
is used.
This command will also create temporary files
.IB tmpprefix . %d .bam
as needed when the entire alignment data cannot fit into memory
(as controlled via the
.B -m
option).

.B Options:
.RS
.TP 11
.BI "-l " INT
Set the desired compression level for the final output file, ranging from 0
(uncompressed) or 1 (fastest but minimal compression) to 9 (best compression
but slowest to write), similarly to
.BR gzip (1)'s
compression level setting.
.IP
If
.B -l
is not used, the default compression level will apply.
.TP
.BI "-m " INT
Approximately the maximum required memory per thread, specified either in bytes
or with a
.BR K ", " M ", or " G
suffix.
[768 MiB]
.IP
To prevent sort from creating a huge number of temporary files, it enforces a
minimum value of 1M for this setting.
.TP
.B -n
Sort by read names (i.e., the
.B QNAME
field) rather than by chromosomal coordinates.
.TP
.BI "-t " TAG
Sort first by the value in the alignment tag TAG, then by position or name (if
also using \fB-n\fP).
.BI "-o " FILE
Write the final sorted output to
.IR FILE ,
rather than to standard output.
.TP
.BI "-O " FORMAT
Write the final output as
.BR sam ", " bam ", or " cram .

By default, samtools tries to select a format based on the
.B -o
filename extension; if output is to standard output or no format can be
deduced,
.B bam
is selected.
.TP
.BI "-T " PREFIX
Write temporary files to
.IB PREFIX . nnnn .bam,
or if the specified
.I PREFIX
is an existing directory, to
.IB PREFIX /samtools. mmm . mmm .tmp. nnnn .bam,
where
.I mmm
is unique to this invocation of the
.B sort
command.
.IP
By default, any temporary files are written alongside the output file, as
.IB out.bam .tmp. nnnn .bam,
or if output is to standard output, in the current directory as
.BI samtools. mmm . mmm .tmp. nnnn .bam.
.TP
.BI "-@ " INT
Set number of sorting and compression threads.
By default, operation is single-threaded.
.PP
.B Ordering Rules

The following rules are used for ordering records.

If option \fB-t\fP is in use, records are first sorted by the value of
the given alignment tag, and then by position or name (if using \fB-n\fP).
For example, \*(lq-t RG\*(rq will make read group the primary sort key.  The
rules for ordering by tag are:

.IP \(bu 4
Records that do not have the tag are sorted before ones that do.
.IP \(bu 4
If the types of the tags are different, they will be sorted so
that single character tags (type A) come before array tags (type B), then
string tags (types H and Z), then numeric tags (types f and i).
.IP \(bu 4
Numeric tags (types f and i) are compared by value.  Note that comparisons
of floating-point values are subject to issues of rounding and precision.
.IP \(bu 4
String tags (types H and Z) are compared based on the binary
contents of the tag using the C
.BR strcmp (3)
function.
.IP \(bu 4
Character tags (type A) are compared by binary character value.
.IP \(bu 4
No attempt is made to compare tags of other types \(em notably type B
array values will not be compared.
.PP
When the \fB-n\fP option is present, records are sorted by name.  Names are
compared so as to give a \*(lqnatural\*(rq ordering \(em i.e. sections
consisting of digits are compared numerically while all other sections are
compared based on their binary representation.  This means \*(lqa1\*(rq will
come before \*(lqb1\*(rq and \*(lqa9\*(rq will come before \*(lqa10\*(rq.
Records with the same name will be ordered according to the values of
the READ1 and READ2 flags (see
.BR flags ).

When the \fB-n\fP option is
.B not
present, reads are sorted by reference (according to the order of the @SQ
header records), then by position in the reference, and then by the REVERSE
flag.

.B Note

.PP
Historically
.B samtools sort
also accepted a less flexible way of specifying the final and
temporary output filenames:
.IP
samtools sort
.RB [ -f "] [" -o ]
.I in.bam out.prefix
.PP
This has now been removed.
The previous \fIout.prefix\fP argument (and \fB-f\fP option, if any)
should be changed to an appropriate combination of \fB-T\fP \fIPREFIX\fP
and \fB-o\fP \fIFILE\fP.  The previous \fB-o\fP option should be removed,
as output defaults to standard output.
.RE

.TP \"-------- index
.B index
samtools index
.RB [ -bc ]
.RB [ -m
.IR INT ]
.IR aln.bam | aln.cram
.RI [ out.index ]

Index a coordinate-sorted BAM or CRAM file for fast random access.
(Note that this does not work with SAM files even if they are bgzip
compressed \(em to index such files, use tabix(1) instead.)

This index is needed when
.I region
arguments are used to limit
.B samtools view
and similar commands to particular regions of interest.

If an output filename is given, the index file will be written to
.IR out.index .
Otherwise, for a CRAM file
.IR aln.cram ,
index file
.IB aln.cram .crai
will be created; for a BAM file
.IR aln.bam ,
either
.IB aln.bam .bai
or
.IB aln.bam .csi
will be created, depending on the index format selected.

.B Options:
.RS
.TP 8
.B -b
Create a BAI index.
This is currently the default when no format options are used.
.TP
.B -c
Create a CSI index.
By default, the minimum interval size for the index is 2^14, which is the same
as the fixed value used by the BAI format.
.TP
.BI "-m " INT
Create a CSI index, with a minimum interval size of 2^INT.
.RE

.TP \"-------- idxstats
.B idxstats
samtools idxstats
.IR in.sam | in.bam | in.cram

Retrieve and print stats in the index file corresponding to the input file.
Before calling idxstats, the input BAM file should be indexed by samtools index.

If run on a SAM or CRAM file or an unindexed BAM file, this command
will still produce the same summary statistics, but does so by reading
through the entire file.  This is far slower than using the BAM
indices.

The output is TAB-delimited with each line consisting of reference sequence
name, sequence length, # mapped reads and # unmapped reads. It is written to
stdout.

.TP \"-------- flagstat
.B flagstat
samtools flagstat
.IR in.sam | in.bam | in.cram

Does a full pass through the input file to calculate and print statistics
to stdout.

Provides counts for each of 13 categories based primarily on bit flags in
the FLAG field. Each category in the output is broken down into QC pass and
QC fail, which is presented as "#PASS + #FAIL" followed by a description of
the category.

The first row of output gives the total number of reads that are QC pass and
fail (according to flag bit 0x200). For example:

  122 + 28 in total (QC-passed reads + QC-failed reads)

Which would indicate that there are a total of 150 reads in the input file,
122 of which are marked as QC pass and 28 of which are marked as "not passing
quality controls"

Following this, additional categories are given for reads which are:

.RS 18

0x100 bit set
.TP
supplementary
0x800 bit set
.TP

.B merge
samtools merge [-nur1f] [-h inh.sam] [-R reg] [-b <list>] <out.bam> <in1.bam> [<in2.bam> <in3.bam> ... <inN.bam>]

Merge multiple sorted alignment files, producing a single sorted output file
that contains all the input records and maintains the existing sort order.

If
.BR -h
is specified the @SQ headers of input files will be merged into the specified header, otherwise they will be merged
into a composite header created from the input headers.  If in the process of merging @SQ lines for coordinate sorted
input files, a conflict arises as to the order (for example input1.bam has @SQ for a,b,c and input2.bam has b,a,c)
then the resulting output file will need to be re-sorted back into coordinate order.

Unless the
.BR -c
or
.BR -p
flags are specified then when merging @RG and @PG records into the output header then any IDs found to be duplicates
of existing IDs in the output header will have a suffix appended to them to differentiate them from similar header

Generate pileup for one or multiple BAM files. Alignment records
are grouped by sample (SM) identifiers in @RG header lines. If sample
identifiers are absent, each input file is regarded as one sample.

Samtools mpileup can still produce VCF and BCF output, but this feature is
deprecated and will be removed in a future release.  Please use
.B bcftools mpileup
for this instead.  (Documentation on the deprecated options has been removed
from this manual page, but older versions are available online
at <http://www.htslib.org/doc/>.)

In the pileup format (without
.BR -u \ or \ -g ),
each
line represents a genomic position, consisting of chromosome name,
1-based coordinate, reference base, the number of reads covering the site,
read bases, base qualities and alignment
mapping qualities. Information on match, mismatch, indel, strand,
mapping quality and start and end of a read are all encoded at the read
base column. At this column, a dot stands for a match to the reference
base on the forward strand, a comma for a match on the reverse strand,
a '>' or '<' for a reference skip, `ACGTN' for a mismatch on the forward
strand and `acgtn' for a mismatch on the reverse strand. A pattern
`\\+[0-9]+[ACGTNacgtn]+' indicates there is an insertion between this
reference position and the next reference position. The length of the
insertion is given by the integer in the pattern, followed by the
inserted sequence. Similarly, a pattern `-[0-9]+[ACGTNacgtn]+'
represents a deletion from the reference. The deleted bases will be
presented as `*' in the following lines. Also at the read base column, a
symbol `^' marks the start of a read. The ASCII of the character
following `^' minus 33 gives the mapping quality. A symbol `$' marks the
end of a read segment.

Note that there are two orthogonal ways to specify locations in the
input file; via \fB-r\fR \fIregion\fR and \fB-l\fR \fIfile\fR.  The
former uses (and requires) an index to do random access while the
latter streams through the file contents filtering out the specified
regions, requiring no index.  The two may be used in conjunction.  For
example a BED file containing locations of genes in chromosome 20
could be specified using \fB-r 20 -l chr20.bed\fR, meaning that the
index is used to find chromosome 20 and then it is filtered for the
regions listed in the bed file.

Coefficient for downgrading mapping quality for reads containing

.B BAQ (Base Alignment Quality)
.PP
BAQ is the Phred-scaled probability of a read base being misaligned.
It greatly helps to reduce false SNPs caused by misalignments.
BAQ is calculated using the probabilistic realignment method described
in the paper \*(lqImproving SNP discovery by base alignment quality\*(rq,
Heng Li, Bioinformatics, Volume 27, Issue 8
<https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btr076>

BAQ is turned on when a reference file is supplied using the
.B -f
option.  To disable it, use the
.B -B
option.

It is possible to store pre-calculated BAQ values in a SAM BQ:Z tag.
Samtools mpileup will use the precalculated values if it finds them.
The
.B -E
option can be used to make it ignore the contents of the BQ:Z tag and
force it to recalculate the BAQ scores by making a new alignment.

.RI [ options ]
.I in.bam

Converts a BAM or CRAM into either FASTQ or FASTA format depending on the
command invoked. The files will be automatically compressed if the
file names have a .gz or .bgzf extension.

The input to this program must be collated by name.
Use
.B samtools collate
or
.B samtools sort -n
to ensure this.

For each different QNAME, the input records are categorised according to
the state of the READ1 and READ2 flag bits.
The three categories used are:

1 : Only READ1 is set.

2 : Only READ2 is set.

0 : Either both READ1 and READ2 are set; or neither is set.

The exact meaning of these categories depends on the sequencing technology
used.
It is expected that ordinary single and paired-end sequencing reads will be
in categories 1 and 2 (in the case of paired-end reads, one read of the pair
will be in category 1, the other in category 2).
Category 0 is essentially a \*(lqcatch-all\*(rq for reads that do not
fit into a simple paired-end sequencing model.

For each category only one sequence will be written for a given QNAME.
If more than one record is available for a given QNAME and category,
the first in input file order that has quality values will be used.
If none of the candidate records has quality values, then the first in
input file order will be used instead.

Sequences will be written to standard output unless one of the
.BR -1 , -2 ", or " -0
options is used, in which case sequences for that category will be written to
the specified file.

If a singleton file is specified using the
.B -s
option then only paired sequences will be output for categories 1 and 2;
paired meaning that for a given QNAME there are sequences for both
category 1
.B and
2.
If there is a sequence for only one of categories 1 or 2 then it will be
diverted into the specified singletons file.
This can be used to prepare fastq files for programs that cannot handle
a mixture of paired and singleton reads.

The
.B -s
option only affects category 1 and 2 records.
The output for category 0 will be the same irrespective of the use of this
option.

If present, <prefix> is used to name the temporary files that collate
uses when sorting the data.  If neither the '-O' nor '-o' options are used,
<prefix> must be present and collate will use it to make an output file name
by appending a suffix depending on the format written (.bam by default).

If either the -O or -o option is used, <prefix> is optional.  If <prefix>
is absent, collate will write the temporary files to a system-dependent
location (/tmp on UNIX).

Using -f for fast mode will output \fBonly\fR primary alignments that have
either the READ1 \fBor\fR READ2 flags set (but not both).
Any other alignment records will be filtered out.
The collation will only work correctly if there are no more than two reads
for any given QNAME after filtering.

Fast mode keeps a buffer of alignments in memory so that it can write out
most pairs as soon as they are found instead of storing them in temporary
files.
This allows collate to avoid some work and so finish more quickly compared
to the standard mode.
The number of alignments held can be changed using -r, storing more alignments
uses more memory but increases the number of pairs that can be written early.

While collate normally randomises the ordering of read pairs, fast mode
does not.
Position-dependent biases that would normally be broken up can remain in the
fast collate output.
It is therefore not a good idea to use fast mode when preparing data for
programs that expect randomly ordered paired reads.
For example using fast collate instead of the standard mode may lead to
significantly different results from aligners that estimate library insert
sizes on batches of reads.

.B reheader
samtools reheader
.RB [ -iP ]
.I in.header.sam in.bam

Replace the header in
.I in.bam
with the header in
.IR in.header.sam .
This command is much faster than replacing the header with a
BAM\(->SAM\(->BAM conversion.

By default this command outputs the BAM or CRAM file to standard
output (stdout), but for CRAM format files it has the option to
perform an in-place edit, both reading and writing to the same file.
No validity checking is performed on the header, nor that it is suitable
to use with the sequence data itself.

.B OPTIONS:
.RS
.TP 8
.B -P, --no-PG
Do not generate an @PG header line.
.TP 8
.B -i, --in-place
Perform the header edit in-place, if possible.  This only works on CRAM
files and only if there is sufficient room to store the new header.
The amount of space available will differ for each CRAM file.
.RE

.TP \"-------- cat
.B cat
samtools cat [-b list] [-h header.sam] [-o out.bam] <in1.bam> <in2.bam> [ ... ]

Concatenate BAMs or CRAMs. Although this works on either BAM or CRAM,
all input files must be the same format as each other. The sequence
dictionary of each input file must be identical, although this command
does not check this. This command uses a similar trick to
.B reheader
which enables fast BAM concatenation.

.B OPTIONS:
.RS
.TP 8
.BI "-b " FOFN
Read the list of input BAM or CRAM files from \fIFOFN\fR.  These are
concatenated prior to any files specified on the command line.
Multiple \fB-b\fR \fIFOFN\fR options may be specified to concatenate
multiple lists of BAM/CRAM files.
.TP 8
.BI "-h " FILE
Uses the SAM header from \fIFILE\fR.  By default the header is taken
from the first file to be concatenated.
.TP 8
.BI "-o " FILE
Write the concatenated output to \fIFILE\fR.  By default this is sent

.TP \"-------- rmdup
.B rmdup
samtools rmdup [-sS] <input.srt.bam> <out.bam>

.B This command is obsolete.  Use markdup instead.

Remove potential PCR duplicates: if multiple read pairs have identical
external coordinates, only retain the pair with highest mapping quality.
In the paired-end mode, this command
.B ONLY
works with FR orientation and requires ISIZE is correctly set. It does
not work for unpaired reads (e.g. two ends mapped to different
chromosomes or orphan reads).

.B OPTIONS:

Adds or replaces read group tags in a file.

.B OPTIONS:
.RS
.TP 8
.BI "-r " STRING
Allows you to specify a read group line to append to the header and applies it
to the reads specified by the -m option. If repeated it automatically adds in
tabs between invocations.
.TP 8
.BI "-R " STRING
Allows you to specify the read group ID of an existing @RG line and applies it
to the reads specified.
.TP 8
.BI "-m " MODE
If you choose orphan_only then existing RG tags are not overwritten, if you choose
overwrite_all, existing RG tags are overwritten. The default is overwrite_all.
.TP 8
.BI "-o " STRING
Write the final output to STRING. The default is to write to stdout.

By default, samtools tries to select a format based on the output
filename extension; if output is to standard output or no format can be
deduced,
.B bam
is selected.
.RE

.TP \"-------- calmd
.B calmd
samtools calmd [-Eeubr] [-C capQcoef] <aln.bam> <ref.fasta>

Generate the MD tag. If the MD tag is already present, this command will
give a warning if the MD tag generated is different from the existing
tag. Output SAM by default.

Calmd can also read and write CRAM files although in most cases it is
pointless as CRAM recalculates MD and NM tags on the fly.  The one
exception to this case is where both input and output CRAM files
have been / are being created with the \fIno_ref\fR option.

.B OPTIONS:

.TP \"-------- targetcut
.B targetcut
samtools targetcut [-Q minBaseQ] [-i inPenalty] [-0 em0] [-1 em1] [-2 em2] [-f ref] <in.bam>

This command identifies target regions by examining the continuity of read depth, computes
haploid consensus sequences of targets and outputs a SAM with each sequence corresponding
to a target. When option
.B -f

.TP 8
.BI -b \ STR
Prefix of BAM output. When this option is in use, phase-0 reads will be saved in file

.TP \"-------- depad
.B depad
samtools depad [-SsCu1] [-T ref.fa] [-o output] <in.bam>

Converts a BAM aligned against a padded reference to a BAM aligned
against the depadded reference.  The padded reference may contain
verbatim "*" bases in it, but "*" bases are also counted in the
reference numbering.  This means that a sequence base-call aligned
against a reference "*" is considered to be a cigar match ("M" or "X")
operator (if the base-call is "A", "C", "G" or "T").  After depadding
the reference "*" bases are deleted and such aligned sequence
base-calls become insertions.  Similarly transformations apply for
deletions and padding cigar operations.

.B OPTIONS:
.RS
.TP
.B -S
Ignored for compatibility with previous samtools versions.
Previously this option was required if input was in SAM format, but now the
correct format is automatically detected by examining the first few characters
of input.
.TP

\fB--input-fmt\fR, \fB--input-fmt-option\fR, \fB--output-fmt\fR,
\fB--output-fmt-option\fR, and \fB--reference\fR.
The input format is typically auto-detected so specifying the format
is usually unnecessary and the option is included for completeness.
Note that not all subcommands have all options.  Consult the subcommand
help for more details.

Format strings recognised are "sam", "bam" and "cram".  They may be
followed by a comma separated list of options as \fIkey\fR or

The \fBfmt-option\fR arguments accept either a single \fIoption\fR or
\fIoption\fR=\fIvalue\fR.  Note that some options only work on some
file formats and only on read or write streams.  If value is
unspecified for a boolean option, the value is assumed to be 1.  The
valid options are as follows.
.RS 0
.\" General purpose
.TP 4
.BI level= INT
Output only. Specifies the compression level from 1 to 9, or 0 for
uncompressed.
.TP
.BI nthreads= INT
Specifies the number of threads to use during encoding and/or
decoding.  For BAM this will be encoding only.  In CRAM the threads
are dynamically shared between encoder and decoder.
.\" CRAM specific
.TP
.BI reference= fasta_file
Specifies a FASTA reference file for use in CRAM encoding or decoding.
It usually is not required for decoding except in the situation of the
MD5 not being obtainable via the REF_PATH or REF_CACHE environment variables.
.TP
.BI decode_md= 0|1
CRAM input only; defaults to 1 (on).  CRAM does not typically store
MD and NM tags, preferring to generate them on the fly.  When this 
option is 0 missing MD, NM tags will not be generated.  It can be 
particularly useful when combined with a file encoded using store_md=1 
and store_nm=1.
.TP
.BI store_md= 0|1
CRAM output only; defaults to 0 (off).  CRAM normally only stores MD
tags when the reference is unknown and lets the decoder generate these
values on-the-fly (see decode_md).
.TP
.BI store_nm= 0|1
CRAM output only; defaults to 0 (off).  CRAM normally only stores NM
tags when the reference is unknown and lets the decoder generate these
values on-the-fly (see decode_md).
.TP
.BI ignore_md5= 0|1
CRAM input only; defaults to 0 (off).  When enabled, md5 checksum
errors on the reference sequence and block checksum errors within CRAM
are ignored.  Use of this option is strongly discouraged.
.TP
.BI required_fields= bit-field
CRAM input only; specifies which SAM columns need to be populated.
By default all fields are used.  Limiting the decode to specific
columns can have significant performance gains.  The bit-field is a
numerical value constructed from the following table.

CRAM input only; defaults to output filename.  Any sequences with
auto-generated read names will use \fIstring\fR as the name prefix.
.TP
.BI multi_seq_per_slice= 0|1
CRAM output only; defaults to 0 (off).  By default CRAM generates one
container per reference sequence, except in the case of many small
references (such as a fragmented assembly).
.TP
.BI version= major.minor
CRAM output only.  Specifies the CRAM version number.  Acceptable

.TP
.BI seqs_per_slice= INT
CRAM output only; defaults to 10000.
.TP
.BI slices_per_container= INT
CRAM output only; defaults to 1.  The effect of having multiple slices
per container is to share the compression header block between
multiple slices.  This is unlikely to have any significant impact
unless the number of sequences per slice is reduced.  (Together these
two options control the granularity of random access.)
.TP
.BI embed_ref= 0|1
CRAM output only; defaults to 0 (off).  If 1, this will store portions
of the reference sequence in each slice, permitting decode without
having requiring an external copy of the reference sequence.
.TP
.BI no_ref= 0|1
CRAM output only; defaults to 0 (off).  If 1, sequences will be stored
verbatim with no reference encoding.  This can be useful if no
reference is available for the file.

.BI use_bzip2= 0|1
CRAM output only; defaults to 0 (off).  Permits use of bzip2 in CRAM
block compression.

.SH REFERENCE SEQUENCES
.PP
The CRAM format requires use of a reference sequence for both reading
and writing.
.PP
When reading a CRAM the \fB@SQ\fR headers are interrogated to identify
the reference sequence MD5sum (\fBM5:\fR tag) and the local reference
sequence filename (\fBUR:\fR tag).  Note that \fIhttp://\fR and
\fIftp://\fR based URLs in the UR: field are not used, but local fasta
filenames (with or without \fIfile://\fR) can be used.
.PP
To create a CRAM the \fB@SQ\fR headers will also be read to identify
the reference sequences, but M5: and UR: tags may not be present. In
this case the \fB-T\fR and \fB-t\fR options of samtools view may be
used to specify the fasta or fasta.fai filenames respectively
(provided the .fasta.fai file is also backed up by a .fasta file).
.PP
The search order to obtain a reference is:
.IP 1. 3
Use any local file specified by the command line options (eg -T).
.IP 2. 3
Look for MD5 via REF_CACHE environment variable.
.IP 3. 3
Look for MD5 in each element of the REF_PATH environment variable.
.IP 4. 3
Look for a local file listed in the UR: header tag.
.PP
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.PP
.TP
.B HTS_PATH
A colon-separated list of directories in which to search for HTSlib plugins.
If $HTS_PATH starts or ends with a colon or contains a double colon (\fB::\fP),
the built-in list of directories is searched at that point in the search.

If no HTS_PATH variable is defined, the built-in list of directories
specified when HTSlib was built is used, which typically includes
\fB/usr/local/libexec/htslib\fP and similar directories.

.TP
.B REF_PATH
A colon separated (semi-colon on Windows) list of locations in which
to look for sequences identified by their MD5sums.  This can be either
a list of directories or URLs. Note that if a URL is included then the
colon in http:// and ftp:// and the optional port number will be
treated as part of the URL and not a PATH field separator.
For URLs, the text \fB%s\fR will be replaced by the MD5sum being
read.

If no REF_PATH has been specified it will default to
\fBhttp://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/cram/md5/%s\fR and if REF_CACHE is also unset,
it will be set to \fB$XDG_CACHE_HOME/hts-ref/%2s/%2s/%s\fR.
If \fB$XDG_CACHE_HOME\fR is unset, \fB$HOME/.cache\fR (or a local system
temporary directory if no home directory is found) will be used similarly.

.TP
.B REF_CACHE
This can be defined to a single directory housing a local cache of
references.  Upon downloading a reference it will be stored in the
location pointed to by REF_CACHE.  When reading a reference it will be
looked for in this directory before searching REF_PATH.  To avoid many
files being stored in the same directory, a pathname may be
constructed using %\fInum\fRs and %s notation, consuming \fInum\fR
characters of the MD5sum.  For example
\fB/local/ref_cache/%2s/%2s/%s\fR will create 2 nested subdirectories
with the filenames in the deepest directory being the last 28
characters of the md5sum.

The REF_CACHE directory will be searched for before attempting to load
via the REF_PATH search list.  If no REF_PATH is defined, both
REF_PATH and REF_CACHE will be automatically set (see above), but if
REF_PATH is defined and REF_CACHE not then no local cache is used.

To aid population of the REF_CACHE directory a script
\fBmisc/seq_cache_populate.pl\fR is provided in the Samtools
distribution. This takes a fasta file or a directory of fasta files
and generates the MD5sum named files.

samtools merge -rh rg.txt merged.bam ga.bam 454.bam
.EE
The value in a

.IR RG:Z:ga ,
while reads from
.I 454.bam
will be attached
.IR RG:Z:454 .

.IP o 2
Convert a BAM file to a CRAM with NM and MD tags stored verbatim
rather than calculating on the fly during CRAM decode, so that mixed
data sets with MD/NM only on some records, or NM calculated using
different definitions of mismatch, can be decoded without change.  The
second command demonstrates how to decode such a file.  The request to
not decode MD here is turning off auto-generation of both MD and NM;
it will still emit the MD/NM tags on records that had these stored
verbatim.

.EE
The
.B bcftools filter
command marks low quality sites and sites with the read depth exceeding
a limit, which should be adjusted to about twice the average read depth
(bigger read depths usually indicate problematic regions which are
often enriched for artefacts).  One may consider to add
.B -C50

.B mpileup
if mapping quality is overestimated for reads containing excessive
mismatches. Applying this option usually helps
.B BWA-short
but may not other mappers.

Individuals are identified from the
.B SM
tags in the
.B @RG
header lines. Individuals can be pooled in one alignment file; one
individual can also be separated into multiple files. The
.B -P
option specifies that indel candidates should be collected only from
read groups with the
.B @RG-PL
tag set to
.IR ILLUMINA .
Collecting indel candidates from reads sequenced by an indel-prone
technology may affect the performance of indel calling.
