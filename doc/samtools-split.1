.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
samtools split
.RI [ options ]
.IR merged.sam | merged.bam | merged.cram

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Splits a file by read group, producing one or more output files
matching a common prefix (by default based on the input filename)
each containing one read-group.

Records without an RG tag or with an RG tag undefined in the header will cause
the program to exit with an error unless the \fB-u\fR option is used.

RG values defined in the header but with no records will produce an output file
only containing a header.

The \fB-u\fR option may be used to specify the output filename for any
records with a missing or unrecognised RG tag.  This option will always write
out a file even if there are no records.

Output format defaults to BAM.  For SAM or CRAM then either set the format with
\fB--output-fmt\fR or use \fB-f\fR to set the file extension e.g.
\fB-f %*_%#.sam\fR. 

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 14
.BI "-u " FILE1
.RI "Put reads with no RG tag or an unrecognised RG tag into " FILE1
.TP
.BI "-h " FILE2
.RI "Use the header from " FILE2 " when writing the file given in the " -u
option.
This header completely replaces the one from the input file.
It must be compatible with the input file header, which means it must
have the same number of references listed in the @SQ lines and the
references must be in the same order and have the same lengths.
.TP
.BI "-f " STRING
Output filename format string (see below)
["%*_%#.%."]
.TP
.B -v
Verbose output
.TP
.BI --no-PG
Do not add a @PG line to the header of the output file.
.PP
Format string expansions:
.TS
center;
lb l .
%%	%
%*	basename
%#	@RG index
%!	@RG ID
%.	output format filename extension
.TE
.TP
.BI "-@, --threads " INT
Number of input/output compression threads to use in addition to main thread [0].
