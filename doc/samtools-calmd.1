.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
samtools calmd
.RB [ -Eeubr ]
.RB [ -C
.IR capQcoef "] " aln.bam " " ref.fasta

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Generate the MD tag. If the MD tag is already present, this command will
give a warning if the MD tag generated is different from the existing
tag. Output SAM by default.

Calmd can also read and write CRAM files although in most cases it is
pointless as CRAM recalculates MD and NM tags on the fly.  The one
exception to this case is where both input and output CRAM files
have been / are being created with the \fIno_ref\fR option.

Note that some aligners do not include sequence or confidence values
in secondary and supplementary alignment records.
Where this happens in SAM files, a \(lq*\(rq character will be
seen in the \fBSEQ\fR and \fBQUAL\fR columns.
These records will be skipped, as it is not possible to recalculate
the MD and NM tags without access to the query sequence.
.B samtools calmd
will emit a warning if any records have been skipped for this reason.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
.B -A
When used jointly with
.B -r
this option overwrites the original base quality.
.TP 8
.B -e
Convert a the read base to = if it is identical to the aligned reference
base. Indel caller does not support the = bases at the moment.
.TP
.B -u
Output uncompressed BAM
.TP
.B -b
Output compressed BAM
.TP
.BI -C \ INT
Coefficient to cap mapping quality of poorly mapped reads. See the
.B mpileup
command for details. [0]
.TP
.B -r
Compute the BQ tag (without -A) or cap base quality by BAQ (with -A).
.TP
.B -E
Extended BAQ calculation. This option trades specificity for sensitivity, though the
effect is minor.
.TP
.BI --no-PG
Do not add a @PG line to the header of the output file.
.TP
.BI "-@, --threads " INT
Number of input/output compression threads to use in addition to main thread [0].

.SH EXAMPLES
.IP o 2
Dump BAQ applied alignment for other SNP callers:
.EX 2
samtools calmd -bAr aln.bam > aln.baq.bam
.EE
It adds and corrects the
.B NM
and
.B MD
tags at the same time. The
.B calmd
command also comes with the
.B -C
option, the same as the one in
.BR mpileup .
Apply if it helps.
