.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Generate text pileup output for one or multiple BAM files.
Each input file produces a separate group of pileup columns in the output.

Samtools mpileup can still produce VCF and BCF output (with
.BR -g \ or \ -u ),
but this feature is
deprecated and will be removed in a future release.  Please use
.B bcftools mpileup
for this instead.  (Documentation on the deprecated options has been removed
from this manual page, but older versions are available online
at <http://www.htslib.org/doc/>.)

Note that there are two orthogonal ways to specify locations in the
input file; via \fB-r\fR \fIregion\fR and \fB-l\fR \fIfile\fR.  The
former uses (and requires) an index to do random access while the
latter streams through the file contents filtering out the specified
regions, requiring no index.  The two may be used in conjunction.  For
example a BED file containing locations of genes in chromosome 20
could be specified using \fB-r 20 -l chr20.bed\fR, meaning that the
index is used to find chromosome 20 and then it is filtered for the
regions listed in the bed file.

.SS Pileup Format
Pileup format consists of TAB-separated lines, with each line representing
the pileup of reads at a single genomic position.

Several columns contain numeric quality values encoded as individual ASCII
characters.
Each character can range from \(lq!\(rq to \(lq~\(rq and is decoded by
taking its ASCII value and subtracting 33; e.g., \(lqA\(rq encodes the
numeric value 32.

The first three columns give the position and reference:
.IP \(ci 2
Chromosome name.
.IP \(ci 2
1-based position on the chromosome.
.IP \(ci 2
Reference base at this position (this will be \(lqN\(rq on all lines
if \fB-f\fR/\fB--fasta-ref\fR has not been used).
.PP
The remaining columns show the pileup data, and are repeated for each
input BAM file specified:
.IP \(ci 2
Number of reads covering this position.
.IP \(ci 2
Read bases.
This encodes information on matches, mismatches, indels, strand,
mapping quality, and starts and ends of reads.

For each read covering the position, this column contains:
.RS
.IP \(bu 2
If this is the first position covered by the read, a \(lq^\(rq character
followed by the alignment's mapping quality encoded as an ASCII character.
.IP \(bu 2
A single character indicating the read base and the strand to which the read
has been mapped:
.TS
c c c
- - -
ceb ceb l .
Forward	Reverse	Meaning
\&.\fR dot	,\fR comma	Base matches the reference base
ACGTN	acgtn	Base is a mismatch to the reference base
>	<	Reference skip (due to CIGAR \(lqN\(rq)
*	*\fR/\fB#	Deletion of the reference base (CIGAR \(lqD\(rq)
.TE

Deleted bases are shown as \(lq*\(rq on both strands
unless \fB--reverse-del\fR is used, in which case they are shown as \(lq#\(rq
on the reverse strand.
.IP \(bu 2
If there is an insertion after this read base, text matching
\(lq\\+[0-9]+[ACGTNacgtn*#]+\(rq: a \(lq+\(rq character followed by an integer
giving the length of the insertion and then the inserted sequence.
Pads are shown as \(lq*\(rq unless \fB--reverse-del\fR is used,
in which case pads on the reverse strand will be shown as \(lq#\(rq.
.IP \(bu 2
If there is a deletion after this read base, text matching
\(lq-[0-9]+[ACGTNacgtn]+\(rq: a \(lq-\(rq character followed by the deleted
reference bases represented similarly.  (Subsequent pileup lines will
contain \(lq*\(rq for this read indicating the deleted bases.)
.IP \(bu 2
If this is the last position covered by the read, a \(lq$\(rq character.
.RE
.IP \(ci 2
Base qualities, encoded as ASCII characters.
.IP \(ci 2
Alignment mapping qualities, encoded as ASCII characters.
(Column only present when \fB-s\fR/\fB--output-MQ\fR is used.)
.IP \(ci 2
Comma-separated 1-based positions within the alignments, e.g., 5 indicates
that it is the fifth base of the corresponding read that is mapped to this
genomic position.
(Column only present when \fB-O\fR/\fB--output-BP\fR is used.)
.IP \(ci 2
Comma-separated read names.
(Column only present when \fB--output-QNAME\fR is used.)
.IP \(ci 2
Additional columns containing other specified read fields or tags,
as selected via the \fB--output-extra\fR, \fB--output-sep\fR,
and \fB--output-empty\fR options.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 10
.B -6, --illumina1.3+
Assume the quality is in the Illumina 1.3+ encoding.
.TP
.B -A, --count-orphans
Do not skip anomalous read pairs in variant calling.  Anomalous read
pairs are those marked in the FLAG field as paired in sequencing but
without the properly-paired flag set.
.TP
.BI -b,\ --bam-list \ FILE
List of input BAM files, one file per line [null]
.TP
.B -B, --no-BAQ
Disable base alignment quality (BAQ) computation.
See
.B BAQ
below.
.TP
.BI -C,\ --adjust-MQ \ INT
Coefficient for downgrading mapping quality for reads containing
excessive mismatches. Given a read with a phred-scaled probability q of
being generated from the mapped position, the new mapping quality is
about sqrt((INT-q)/INT)*INT. A zero value disables this
functionality; if enabled, the recommended value for BWA is 50. [0]
.TP
.BI -d,\ --max-depth \ INT
At a position, read maximally
.I INT
reads per input file. Setting this limit reduces the amount of memory and
time needed to process regions with very high coverage.  Passing zero for this
option sets it to the highest possible value, effectively removing the depth
limit. [8000]

Note that up to release 1.8, samtools would enforce a minimum value for
this option.  This no longer happens and the limit is set exactly as
specified.
.TP
.B -E, --redo-BAQ
Recalculate BAQ on the fly, ignore existing BQ tags.
See
.B BAQ
below.
.TP
.BI -f,\ --fasta-ref \ FILE
The
.BR faidx -indexed
reference file in the FASTA format. The file can be optionally compressed by
.BR bgzip .
[null]

Supplying a reference file will enable base alignment quality calculation
for all reads aligned to a reference in the file.  See
.B BAQ
below.
.TP
.BI -G,\ --exclude-RG \ FILE
Exclude reads from readgroups listed in FILE (one @RG-ID per line)
.TP
.BI -l,\ --positions \ FILE
BED or position list file containing a list of regions or sites where
pileup or BCF should be generated. Position list files contain two
columns (chromosome and position) and start counting from 1.  BED
files contain at least 3 columns (chromosome, start and end position)
and are 0-based half-open.
.br
While it is possible to mix both position-list and BED coordinates in
the same file, this is strongly ill advised due to the differing
coordinate systems. [null]
.TP
.BI -q,\ --min-MQ \ INT
Minimum mapping quality for an alignment to be used [0]
.TP
.BI -Q,\ --min-BQ \ INT
Minimum base quality for a base to be considered [13]
.TP
.BI -r,\ --region \ STR
Only generate pileup in region. Requires the BAM files to be indexed.
If used in conjunction with -l then considers the intersection of the
two requests.
.I STR
[all sites]
.TP
.B -R,\ --ignore-RG
Ignore RG tags. Treat all reads in one BAM as one sample.
.TP
.BI --rf,\ --incl-flags \ STR|INT
Required flags: skip reads with mask bits unset [null]
.TP
.BI --ff,\ --excl-flags \ STR|INT
Filter flags: skip reads with mask bits set
[UNMAP,SECONDARY,QCFAIL,DUP]
.TP
.B -x,\ --ignore-overlaps
Disable read-pair overlap detection.
.TP
.B -X
Include customized index file as a part of arguments. See
.B EXAMPLES
section for sample of usage.

.PP
.B Output Options:
.TP 10
.BI "-o, --output " FILE
Write pileup output to
.IR FILE ,
rather than the default of standard output.

(The same short option is used for both the deprecated
.BR --open-prob
option and
.BR --output .
If
.BR -o 's
argument contains any non-digit characters other than a leading + or - sign,
it is interpreted as
.BR --output .
Usually the filename extension will take care of this, but to write to an
entirely numeric filename use
.B -o ./123
or
.BR "--output 123" .)
.TP
.B -O, --output-BP
Output base positions on reads.
.TP
.B -s, --output-MQ
Output mapping quality.
Equivalent to \fB--output-extra MAPQ\fR.
.TP
.B --output-QNAME
Output an extra column containing comma-separated read names.
Equivalent to \fB--output-extra QNAME\fR.
.TP
.BI "--output-extra" \ STR
Output extra columns containing comma-separated values of read fields or read
tags. The names of the selected fields have to be provided as they are
described in the SAM Specification (pag. 6) and will be output by the
mpileup command in the same order as in the document (i.e.
.BR QNAME ", " FLAG ", " RNAME ,...)
The names are case sensitive. Currently, only the following fields are
supported:
.IP
.B QNAME, FLAG, RNAME, POS, MAPQ, RNEXT, PNEXT
.IP
Anything that is not on this list is treated as a potential tag, although only
two character tags are accepted. In the mpileup output, tag columns are
displayed in the order they were provided by the user in the command line.
Field and tag names have to be provided in a comma-separated string to the
mpileup command.
E.g.
.IP
.B samtools mpileup --output-extra FLAG,QNAME,RG,NM in.bam
.IP
will display four extra columns in the mpileup output, the first being a list of
comma-separated read names, followed by a list of flag values, a list of RG tag
values and a list of NM tag values. Field values are always displayed before
tag values.
.TP
.BI "--output-sep" \ CHAR
Specify a different separtor character for tag value lists, when those values
might contain one or more commas (\fB,\fR), which is the default list separator.
This option only affects columns for two-letter tags like NM; standard
fields like FLAG or QNAME will always be separated by commas.
.TP
.BI "--output-empty" \ CHAR
Specify a different 'no value' character for tag list entries corresponding to
reads that don't have a tag requested with the \fB--output-extra\fR option. The
default is \fB*\fR.

This option only applies to rows that have at least one read in the pileup,
and only to columns for two-letter tags.
Columns for empty rows will always be printed as \fB*\fR.
.TP
.B --reverse-del
Mark the deletions on the reverse strand with the character
.BR # , 
instead of the usual
.BR * .
.TP
.B -a
Output all positions, including those with zero depth.
.TP
.B -a -a, -aa
Output absolutely all positions, including unused reference sequences.
Note that when used in conjunction with a BED file the -a option may
sometimes operate as if -aa was specified if the reference sequence
has coverage outside of the region specified in the BED file.
.PP
.B BAQ (Base Alignment Quality)
.PP
BAQ is the Phred-scaled probability of a read base being misaligned.
It greatly helps to reduce false SNPs caused by misalignments.
BAQ is calculated using the probabilistic realignment method described
in the paper \*(lqImproving SNP discovery by base alignment quality\*(rq,
Heng Li, Bioinformatics, Volume 27, Issue 8
<https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btr076>

BAQ is turned on when a reference file is supplied using the
.B -f
option.  To disable it, use the
.B -B
option.

It is possible to store pre-calculated BAQ values in a SAM BQ:Z tag.
Samtools mpileup will use the precalculated values if it finds them.
The
.B -E
option can be used to make it ignore the contents of the BQ:Z tag and
force it to recalculate the BAQ scores by making a new alignment.

.SH EXAMPLES
.IP o 2
Call SNPs and short INDELs:
.EX 2
samtools mpileup -uf ref.fa aln.bam | bcftools call -mv > var.raw.vcf
bcftools filter -s LowQual -e '%QUAL<20 || DP>100' var.raw.vcf  > var.flt.vcf
.EE
The
.B bcftools filter
command marks low quality sites and sites with the read depth exceeding
a limit, which should be adjusted to about twice the average read depth
(bigger read depths usually indicate problematic regions which are
often enriched for artefacts).  One may consider to add
.B -C50
to
.B mpileup
if mapping quality is overestimated for reads containing excessive
mismatches. Applying this option usually helps
.B BWA-short
but may not other mappers.

Individuals are identified from the
.B SM
tags in the
.B @RG
header lines. Individuals can be pooled in one alignment file; one
individual can also be separated into multiple files. The
.B -P
option specifies that indel candidates should be collected only from
read groups with the
.B @RG-PL
tag set to
.IR ILLUMINA .
Collecting indel candidates from reads sequenced by an indel-prone
technology may affect the performance of indel calling.

.IP o 2
Generate the consensus sequence for one diploid individual:
.EX 2
samtools mpileup -uf ref.fa aln.bam | bcftools call -c | vcfutils.pl vcf2fq > cns.fq
.EE
.IP o 2
Include customized index file as a part of arguments.
.EX 2
samtools mpileup [options] -X /data_folder/in1.bam [/data_folder/in2.bam [...]] /index_folder/index1.bai [/index_folder/index2.bai [...]]
.EE
.IP o 2
Phase one individual:
.EX 2
samtools calmd -AEur aln.bam ref.fa | samtools phase -b prefix - > phase.out
.EE
The
.B calmd
command is used to reduce false heterozygotes around INDELs.
