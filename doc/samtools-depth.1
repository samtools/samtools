.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
samtools depth
.RI [ options ]
.RI "[" in1.sam | in1.bam | in1.cram " [" in2.sam | in2.bam | in2.cram "] [...]]"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Computes the depth at each position or region.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
.B -a
Output all positions (including those with zero depth)
.TP
.B -a -a, -aa
Output absolutely all positions, including unused reference sequences.
Note that when used in conjunction with a BED file the -a option may
sometimes operate as if -aa was specified if the reference sequence
has coverage outside of the region specified in the BED file.
.TP
.BI "-b "  FILE
.RI "Compute depth at list of positions or regions in specified BED " FILE.
[]
.TP
.BI "-f " FILE
.RI "Use the BAM files specified in the " FILE
(a file of filenames, one file per line)
[]
.TP
.B -H
Write a comment line showing column names at the beginning of the output.
The names are CHROM, POS, and then the input file name for each depth column.
If one of the inputs came from stdin, the name \*(lq-\*(rq will be used for
the corresponding column.
.TP
.BI "-l " INT
.RI "Ignore reads shorter than " INT
.TP
.BI "-m, -d " INT
At a position, read at most
.I INT
reads per input file.  This means figures greater than
.I INT
may be reported in the output.

Setting this limit reduces the amount of memory and time needed to
process regions with very high coverage.  Passing zero for this option
sets it to the highest possible value, effectively removing the depth
limit. [8000]

Note that up to release 1.8, samtools would enforce a minimum value for
this option.  This no longer happens and the limit is set exactly as
specified.
.TP
.BI "-o " FILE
.RI "Write output to " FILE ".  Using \*(lq-\*(rq for " FILE
will send the output to stdout (also the default if this option is not used).
.TP
.BI "-q " INT
.RI "Only count reads with base quality greater than " INT
.TP
.BI "-Q " INT
.RI "Only count reads with mapping quality greater than " INT
.TP
.BI "-r " CHR ":" FROM "-" TO
Only report depth in specified region.
