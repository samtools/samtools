.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Text alignment viewer (based on the ncurses library). In the viewer,
press `?' for help and press `g' to check the alignment start from a
region in the format like `chr10:10,000,000' or `=10,000,000' when
viewing the same reference sequence.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 14
.BI -d \ display
Output as (H)tml, (C)urses or (T)ext.

The width of generated text is controlled by the COLUMNS environment
variable.  Note this may be a local shell variable so it may need
exporting first or specifying on the command line prior to the
command.  For example
.EX 2
export COLUMNS ; samtools tview -d T -p 1:234567 in.bam
.EE
.TP
.BI -p \ chr:pos
Go directly to this position
.TP
.BI -s \ STR
Display only alignments from this sample or read group
.TP
.B -X
If this option is set, it will allows user to specify customized index file location(s) if the data
folder does not contain any index file. Example usage: samtools tview [options] -X </data_folder/data.bam> [/index_folder/index.bai] [ref.fasta]
