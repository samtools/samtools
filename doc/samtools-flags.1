.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Convert between textual and numeric flag representation.

Each \fIFLAGS\fP argument may be either an integer (in decimal, hexadecimal,
or octal) representing a combination of the listed numeric flag values,
or a comma-separated string \fINAME\fB,\fR...\fB,\fINAME\fR representing
a combination of the flag names listed below.

.B FLAGS:
.TS
rb l l .
0x1	PAIRED	paired-end (or multiple-segment) sequencing technology
0x2	PROPER_PAIR	each segment properly aligned according to the aligner
0x4	UNMAP	segment unmapped
0x8	MUNMAP	next segment in the template unmapped
0x10	REVERSE	SEQ is reverse complemented
0x20	MREVERSE	SEQ of the next segment in the template is reverse complemented
0x40	READ1	the first segment in the template
0x80	READ2	the last segment in the template
0x100	SECONDARY	secondary alignment
0x200	QCFAIL	not passing quality controls
0x400	DUP	PCR or optical duplicate
0x800	SUPPLEMENTARY	supplementary alignment
