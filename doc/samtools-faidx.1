.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
samtools faidx
.IR ref.fasta " [" region1 " [...]]"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Index reference sequence in the FASTA format or extract subsequence from
indexed reference sequence. If no region is specified,
.B faidx
will index the file and create
.I <ref.fasta>.fai
on the disk. If regions are specified, the subsequences will be
retrieved and printed to stdout in the FASTA format.

The input file can be compressed in the
.B BGZF
format.

The sequences in the input file should all have different names.
If they do not, indexing will emit a warning about duplicate sequences and
retrieval will only produce subsequences from the first sequence with the
duplicated name.

FASTQ files can be read and indexed by this command.  Without using
.B --fastq
any extracted subsequence will be in FASTA format.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP 8
.BI "-o, --output " FILE
Write FASTA to file rather than to stdout.
.TP
.BI "-n, --length " INT
Length of FASTA sequence line.
[60]
.TP
.B -c, --continue
Continue working if a non-existent region is requested.
.TP
.BI "-r, --region-file " FILE
Read regions from a file. Format is chr:from-to, one per line.
.TP
.B -f, --fastq
Read FASTQ files and output extracted sequences in FASTQ format.  Same as using samtools fqidx.
.TP
.B -i, --reverse-complement
Output the sequence as the reverse complement.
When this option is used, \*(lq/rc\*(rq will be appended to the sequence names.
To turn this off or change the string appended, use the
.B --mark-strand
option.
.TP
.B     --mark-strand TYPE
Append strand indicator to sequence name.  TYPE can be one of:
.RS
.TP
.B rc
Append '/rc' when writing the reverse complement.  This is the default.
.TP
.B no
Do not append anything.
.TP
.B sign
Append '(+)' for forward strand or '(-)' for reverse complement.  This matches
the output of \*(lqbedtools getfasta -s\*(rq.
.TP
.B custom,<pos>,<neg>
Append string <pos> to names when writing the forward strand and <neg> when
writing the reverse strand.  Spaces are preserved, so it is possible to move
the indicator into the comment part of the description line by including
a leading space in the strings <pos> and <neg>.
.RE
.TP
.B --fai-idx FILE
Read/Write to specified index file.
.TP
.B --gzi-idx FILE
Read/Write to specified compressed file index (used with .gz files).
.TP
.B -h, --help
Print help message and exit.
