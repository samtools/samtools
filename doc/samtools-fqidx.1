.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
samtools fqidx
.IR ref.fastq " [" region1 " [...]]"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Index reference sequence in the FASTQ format or extract subsequence from
indexed reference sequence. If no region is specified,
.B fqidx
will index the file and create
.I <ref.fastq>.fai
on the disk. If regions are specified, the subsequences will be
retrieved and printed to stdout in the FASTQ format.

The input and output can be files compressed in the
.B BGZF
format. When output is compressed, the default compression level is 4.

The sequences in the input file should all have different names.
If they do not, indexing will emit a warning about duplicate sequences and
retrieval will only produce subsequences from the first sequence with the
duplicated name.

.B samtools fqidx
should only be used on fastq files with a small number of entries.
Trying to use it on a file containing millions of short sequencing reads
will produce an index that is almost as big as the original file, and
searches using the index will be very slow and use a lot of memory.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
.BI "-o, --output " FILE
Write FASTQ to file rather than to stdout. With .gz, .bgz, .bgzf file extensions
the output will be
.B BGZF
compressed.
.TP
.BI "-n, --length " INT
Length for FASTQ sequence line wrapping.  If zero, this means do not
line wrap.  Defaults to the line length in the input file.
.TP
.B -c, --continue
Continue working if a non-existent region is requested.
.TP
.BI "-r, --region-file " FILE
Read regions from a file. Format is chr:from-to, one per line.
.TP
.B -i, --reverse-complement
Output the sequence as the reverse complement.
When this option is used, \*(lq/rc\*(rq will be appended to the sequence names.
To turn this off or change the string appended, use the
.B --mark-strand
option.
.TP
.B     --mark-strand TYPE
Append strand indicator to sequence name.  TYPE can be one of:
.RS
.TP
.B rc
Append '/rc' when writing the reverse complement.  This is the default.
.TP
.B no
Do not append anything.
.TP
.B sign
Append '(+)' for forward strand or '(-)' for reverse complement.  This matches
the output of \*(lqbedtools getfasta -s\*(rq.
.TP
.B custom,<pos>,<neg>
Append string <pos> to names when writing the forward strand and <neg> when
writing the reverse strand.  Spaces are preserved, so it is possible to move
the indicator into the comment part of the description line by including
a leading space in the strings <pos> and <neg>.
.RE
.TP
.B --fai-idx FILE
Read/Write to specified index file.
.TP
.B --gzi-idx FILE
Read/Write to specified compressed file index (used with .gz files).
.TP
.B -h, --help
Print help message and exit.
.TP
.BI --output-fmt-option\  OPT=VAL
Set the output format options, level=0..9 for compression level 0 to 9.
.TP
.BI --write-index
Create index for the output sequence data along with the output, in same path as
<output name>.fai, <outputname>.gzi. This option is valid only for file output.
.TP
.BI "-@, --threads " N
Set the number of extra threads for operations on compressed files.
