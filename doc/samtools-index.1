.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
samtools index
.RB [ -bc ]
.RB [ -m
.IR INT ]
.IR aln.sam | aln.bam | aln.cram
.RI [ out.index ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Index a coordinate-sorted BGZIP-compressed SAM, BAM or CRAM file for fast
random access.
Note for SAM this only works if the file has been BGZF compressed first.

This index is needed when
.I region
arguments are used to limit
.B samtools view
and similar commands to particular regions of interest.

If an output filename is given, the index file will be written to
.IR out.index .
Otherwise, for a CRAM file
.IR aln.cram ,
index file
.IB aln.cram .crai
will be created; for a BAM file
.IR aln.bam ,
either
.IB aln.bam .bai
or
.IB aln.bam .csi
will be created; and for a compressed SAM file
.IR aln.sam.gz ,
either
.IB aln.sam.gz .bai
or
.IB aln.sam.gz .csi
will be created, depending on the index format selected.

The BAI index format can handle individual chromosomes up to 512 Mbp
(2^29 bases) in length.
If your input file might contain reads mapped to positions greater than that,
you will need to use a CSI index.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
.B -b
Create a BAI index.
This is currently the default when no format options are used.
.TP
.B -c
Create a CSI index.
By default, the minimum interval size for the index is 2^14, which is the same
as the fixed value used by the BAI format.
.TP
.BI "-m " INT
Create a CSI index, with a minimum interval size of 2^INT.
.TP
.BI "-@, --threads " INT
Number of input/output compression threads to use in addition to main thread [0].
