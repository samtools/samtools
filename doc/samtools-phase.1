.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Call and phase heterozygous SNPs.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
.B -A
Drop reads with ambiguous phase.
.TP 8
.BI -b \ STR
Prefix of BAM output. When this option is in use, phase-0 reads will be saved in file
.BR STR .0.bam
and phase-1 reads in
.BR STR .1.bam.
Phase unknown reads will be randomly allocated to one of the two files. Chimeric reads
with switch errors will be saved in
.BR STR .chimeric.bam.
[null]
.TP
.B -F
Do not attempt to fix chimeric reads.
.TP
.BI -k \ INT
Maximum length for local phasing. [13]
.TP
.BI -q \ INT
Minimum Phred-scaled LOD to call a heterozygote. [40]
.TP
.BI -Q \ INT
Minimum base quality to be used in het calling. [13]
.TP
.BI --no-PG
Do not add a @PG line to the header of the output file.
