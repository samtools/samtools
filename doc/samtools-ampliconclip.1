.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Clip reads in a SAM compatible file based on data from a BED file.  By default
the reads are soft clipped and clip is only done from the 5' end.

Some things to be aware of.  While ordering is not significant, adjustments to
the left most mapping position (\fIPOS\fR) will mean that coordinate sorted
files will need resorting.  In such cases the sorting order in the header is set
to unknown. Clipping of reads results in template length (\fITLEN\fR) being
incorrect. This can be corrected by \fBsamtools fixmates\fR.  Any \fIMD\fR and
\fINM\fR aux tags will also be incorrect, which can be fixed by \fBsamtools
calmd\fR.
