.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Clip reads in a SAM compatible file based on data from a BED file.  By default
the reads are soft clipped and clip is only done from the 5' end.

Some things to be aware of.  While ordering is not significant, adjustments to
the left most mapping position (\fIPOS\fR) will mean that coordinate sorted
files will need resorting.  In such cases the sorting order in the header is set
to unknown. Clipping of reads results in template length (\fITLEN\fR) being
incorrect. This can be corrected by \fBsamtools fixmates\fR.  Any \fIMD\fR and
\fINM\fR aux tags will also be incorrect, which can be fixed by \fBsamtools
calmd\fR.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 11
.BI "-b " FILE
BED file of amplicons to be removed.
.TP
.BI "-o " FILE
Output file name (defaults to stdout).
.TP
.BI "-f " FILE
File to write stats to (defaults to stderr).
.TP
.B --soft-clip
Soft clip reads (default).
.TP
.B --hard-clip
Hard clip reads.
.TP
.B --both-ends
Clip at both ends as opposed to just the 5' end.
.TP
.B --strand
Use strand entry from the BED file.
.TP
.B --clipped
Only output clipped reads.  Filter all others.
.TP
.B --fail
Mark unclipped reads as QC fail.
.TP
.BI "--filter-len " INT
Filter out reads of INT size or shorter.  In this case soft clips are not counted
toward read length.  An INT of 0 will filter out reads with no matching bases.
.TP
.BI "--fail-len " INT
As \fB--filter-len\fR but mark as QC fail rather then filter out.
.TP
.B --no-excluded
Filter out any reads that are marked as QCFAIL or are unmapped.  This works on
the state of the reads before clipping takes place.
.TP
.BI "--rejects-file " FILE
Write any filtered reads out to a file.
.TP
.B --no-PG
Do not at a PG line to the header.
