.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Adds or replaces read group tags in a file.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
.BI "-r " STRING
Allows you to specify a read group line to append to the header and applies it
to the reads specified by the -m option. If repeated it automatically adds in
tabs between invocations.
.TP 8
.BI "-R " STRING
Allows you to specify the read group ID of an existing @RG line and applies it
to the reads specified.
.TP 8
.BI "-m " MODE
If you choose orphan_only then existing RG tags are not overwritten, if you choose
overwrite_all, existing RG tags are overwritten. The default is overwrite_all.
.TP 8
.BI "-o " STRING
Write the final output to STRING. The default is to write to stdout.

By default, samtools tries to select a format based on the output
filename extension; if output is to standard output or no format can be
deduced,
.B sam
is selected.
.TP 8
.B -u
Output uncompressed SAM, BAM or CRAM.
.TP 8
.BI --no-PG
Do not add a @PG line to the header of the output file.
.TP 8
.BI "-@, --threads " INT
Number of input/output compression threads to use in addition to main thread [0].
