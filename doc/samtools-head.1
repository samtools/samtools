.SH SYNOPSIS
.B samtools head
.RB [ -h
.IR INT ]
.RB [ -n
.IR INT ]
.RI [ FILE ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
By default, prints all headers from the specified input file to standard output
in SAM format.
The input alignment file may be in SAM, BAM, or CRAM format; if no \fIFILE\fR
is specified, standard input will be read.
With appropriate options, only some of the headers and/or additionally some
of the alignment records will be printed.
.P
The \fBsamtools head\fR command outputs SAM headers exactly as they appear
in the input file; in particular, it never adds an @PG header itself.
(Other \fBsamtools\fR commands add such @PG headers to facilitate provenance
tracking in analysis pipelines, but because \fBsamtools head\fR never outputs
more than a handful of alignment records it is unsuitable for use in such
contexts anyway.)

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 4n
.BI "-h, --headers " INT
Display only the first \fIINT\fR header lines.
By default, all header lines are displayed.
.TP
.BI "-n, --records " INT
Also display the first \fIINT\fR alignment records.
By default, no alignment records are displayed.
