Not all sections will be reported as some depend on the data being
coordinate sorted while others are only present when specific barcode
tags are in use.

Some of the statistics are collected for \*(lqfirst\*(rq or \*(lqlast\*(rq
fragments.
Records are put into these categories using the PAIRED (0x1), READ1 (0x40)
and READ2 (0x80) flag bits, as follows:

.IP \(bu 4
Unpaired reads (i.e. PAIRED is not set) are all \*(lqfirst\*(rq fragments.
For these records, the READ1 and READ2 flags are ignored.
.IP \(bu 4
Reads where PAIRED and READ1 are set, and READ2 is not set are \*(lqfirst\*(rq
fragments.
.IP \(bu 4
Reads where PAIRED and READ2 are set, and READ1 is not set are \*(lqlast\*(rq
fragments.
.IP \(bu 4
Reads where PAIRED is set and either both READ1 and READ2 are set or
neither is set are not counted in either category.
.PP
The CHK row contains distinct CRC32 checksums of read names, sequences
and quality values.  The checksums are computed per alignment record
and summed, meaning the checksum does not change if the input file has
the sort-order changed.

The SN section contains a series of counts, percentages, and averages, in a similar style to
.BR "samtools flagstat" ,
but more comprehensive.

The FFQ and LFQ sections report the quality distribution per
first/last fragment and per cycle number.  They have one row per cycle
(reported as the first column after the FFQ/LFQ key) with remaining
columns being the observed integer counts per quality value, starting
at quality 0 in the left-most row and ending at the largest observed
quality.  Thus each row forms its own quality distribution and any
cycle specific quality artefacts can be observed.

GCF and GCL report the total GC content of each fragment, separated
into first and last fragments.  The columns show the GC percentile
(between 0 and 100) and an integer count of fragments at that
percentile.

GCC, FBC and LBC report the nucleotide content per cycle either combined
(GCC) or split into first (FBC) and last (LBC) fragments.  The columns
are cycle number (integer), and percentage counts for A, C, G, T, N
and other (typically containing ambiguity codes) normalised against
the total counts of A, C, G and T only (excluding N and other).

FTC and LTC report the total numbers of nucleotides for first and last
fragments, respectively. The columns are the raw counters for A, C, G,
T and N bases.

BCC, CRC, OXC and RXC are the barcode equivalent of GCC, showing
nucleotide content for the barcode tags BC, CR, OX and RX respectively.
Their quality values distributions are in the QTQ, CYQ, BZQ and
QXQ sections, corresponding to the BC/QT, CR/CY, OX/BZ and RX/QX SAM
format sequence/quality tags.  These quality value distributions
follow the same format used in the FFQ and LFQ sections. All these
section names are followed by a number (1 or 2), indicating that the
stats figures below them correspond to the first or second barcode (in
the case of dual indexing). Thus, these sections will appear as BCC1,
CRC1, OXC1 and RXC1, accompanied by their quality correspondents QTQ1,
CYQ1, BZQ1 and QXQ1. If a separator is present in the barcode sequence
(usually a hyphen), indicating dual indexing, then sections ending in
"2" will also be reported to show the second tag statistics (e.g. both
BCC1 and BCC2 are present).

IS reports insert size distributions with one row per size, reported
in the first column, with subsequent columns for the frequency of
total pairs, inward oriented pairs, outward orient pairs and other
orientation pairs.  The \fB-i\fR option specifies the maximum insert
size reported.

RL reports the distribution for all read lengths, with one row per
observed length (up to the maximum specified by the \fB-l\fR option).
Columns are read length and frequency.  FRL and LRL contains the same
information separated into first and last fragments.

ID reports the distribution of indel sizes, with one row per observed
size. The columns are size, frequency of insertions at that size and
frequency of deletions at that size.

IC reports the frequency of indels occurring per cycle, broken down by
both insertion / deletion and by first / last read.  Note for
multi-base indels this only counts the first base location.  Columns
are cycle, number of insertions in first fragments, number of
insertions in last fragments, number of deletions in first fragments,
and number of deletions in last fragments.

COV reports a distribution of the alignment depth per covered
reference site.  For example an average depth of 50 would ideally
result in a normal distribution centred on 50, but the presence of
repeats or copy-number variation may reveal multiple peaks at
approximate multiples of 50.  The first column is an inclusive
coverage range in the form of \fB[\fImin\fB-\fImax\fB]\fR.  The next
columns are a repeat of the \fImax\fRimum portion of the depth range
(now as a single integer) and the frequency that depth range was
observed.  The minimum, maximum and range step size are controlled by
the \fB-c\fR option.  Depths above and below the minimum and maximum
are reported with ranges \fB[<\fImin\fB]\fR and \fB[\fImax\fB<]\fR.

GCD reports the GC content of the reference data aligned against per
alignment record, with one row per observed GC percentage reported as
the first column and sorted on this column.  The second column is a
total sequence percentile, as a running total (ending at 100%).  The
first and second columns may be used to produce a simple distribution
of GC content.  Subsequent columns list the coverage depth at 10th,
25th, 50th, 75th and 90th GC percentiles for this specific GC
percentage, revealing any GC bias in mapping.  These columns are
averaged depths, so are floating point with no maximum value.
