.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
samtools depad
.RB [ -SsCu1 ]
.RB [ -T
.IR ref.fa ]
.RB [ -o
.IR output "] " in.bam

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Converts a BAM aligned against a padded reference to a BAM aligned
against the depadded reference.  The padded reference may contain
verbatim "*" bases in it, but "*" bases are also counted in the
reference numbering.  This means that a sequence base-call aligned
against a reference "*" is considered to be a cigar match ("M" or "X")
operator (if the base-call is "A", "C", "G" or "T").  After depadding
the reference "*" bases are deleted and such aligned sequence
base-calls become insertions.  Similarly transformations apply for
deletions and padding cigar operations.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -S
Ignored for compatibility with previous samtools versions.
Previously this option was required if input was in SAM format, but now the
correct format is automatically detected by examining the first few characters
of input.
.TP
.B -s
Output in SAM format.  The default is BAM.
.TP
.B -C
Output in CRAM format.  The default is BAM.
.TP
.B -u
Do not compress the output.  Applies to either BAM or CRAM output
format.
.TP
.B -1
Enable fastest compression level.  Only works for BAM or CRAM output.
.TP
.BI "-T " FILE
Provides the padded reference file.  Note that without this the @SQ
line lengths will be incorrect, so for most use cases this option will
be considered as mandatory.
.TP
.BI "-o " FILE
Specifies the output filename.  By default output is sent to stdout.
.TP
.BI --no-PG
Do not add a @PG line to the header of the output file.
