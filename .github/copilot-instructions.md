# Project Overview

This repository contains the source code for the samtools project, a suite of command-line tools for manipulating next-generation sequencing data. The project is written in C.

## GPU Acceleration

- Refactor the tools to use CUDA GPU acceleration for faster processing of large datasets.
- Ensure the code is modular, maintainable, and follows best practices for GPU programming.
- Replace threading with CUDA-based parallel processing to fully leverage GPU capabilities.
- Write comprehensive documentation on building and running the project with GPU support.
- Include unit tests to verify the correctness and performance of GPU-accelerated code.

## Coding Best Practices

- Use clear, concise, and consistent language throughout the codebase and documentation.
- Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable, and reusable modules.
- Add comments to explain non-trivial code sections and GPU-specific logic.
- Organize code logically, separating GPU-specific code from CPU code where possible.
- Use version control effectively:
    - Create feature branches for new features or bug fixes.
    - Regularly merge changes from the main branch to keep feature branches up to date.
    - Use pull requests for code reviews and discussions before merging into the main branch.
    - Write clear, descriptive commit messages explaining the changes made.

## Documentation

- Provide clear build instructions for both CPU-only and GPU-accelerated versions.
- Document dependencies, including CUDA toolkit requirements and supported GPU hardware.
- Include usage examples and performance benchmarks comparing CPU and GPU modes.
- Maintain up-to-date API documentation and code comments.

## Testing

- Implement unit tests for all major components, including GPU-accelerated functions.
- Use automated testing frameworks where possible.
- Ensure tests cover both correctness and performance aspects.

## Code Quality

- Follow established C and CUDA coding standards.
- Use static analysis tools and linters to maintain code quality.
- Regularly review and refactor code to improve readability and maintainability.
