# Code Refactoring Guidelines

- Refactor code to improve readability, maintainability, and performance.
- Ensure the codebase is modular, maintainable, and follows industry best practices.
- Remove any unnecessary, redundant, or unused code and files from the project.
- Use clear, concise, and consistent naming conventions and language throughout code and documentation.
- Optimize code for performance wherever possible.
- Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable, and reusable modules.
- Add comments to explain non-trivial code sections, especially GPU-specific logic.
- Organize code logically, separating GPU-specific code from CPU code where possible.

## Version Control Best Practices

- Use feature branches for new features or bug fixes.
- Regularly merge changes from the main branch to keep feature branches up to date.
- Use pull requests for code reviews and discussions before merging into the main branch.
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages explaining the changes made.
