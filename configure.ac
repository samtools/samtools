   Autoheader adds a number of items to this template file that are not
   used by samtools: STDC_HEADERS and most HAVE_*_H header file defines
   are immaterial, as we assume standard ISO C headers and facilities;
   the PACKAGE_* defines are unused and are overridden by the more
   accurate PACKAGE_VERSION as computed by the Makefile.  */])

requires an unpacked HTSlib source tree (which will be built in conjunction
with samtools) or a previously-installed HTSlib.  In either case you may
need to configure --with-htslib=DIR to locate the appropriate HTSlib.
