Samtools implements various utilities for post-processing alignments in the
SAM, BAM, and CRAM formats, including indexing, variant calling (in conjunction
with bcftools), and a simple alignment viewer.


Building samtools
=================

The typical simple case of building Samtools using the HTSlib bundled within
this Samtools release tarball is done as follows:

    cd .../samtools-1.17 # Within the unpacked release directory
    ./configure
    make

You may wish to copy the resulting samtools executable into somewhere on your
$PATH, or run it where it is.

Rather than running-in-place like that, the next simplest typical case is to
install samtools etc properly into a directory of your choosing.  Building for
installation using the HTSlib bundled within this Samtools release tarball,
and building the various HTSlib utilities such as bgzip is done as follows:

    cd .../samtools-1.17 # Within the unpacked release directory
    ./configure --prefix=/path/to/location
    make all all-htslib
    make install install-htslib

You will likely wish to add /path/to/location/bin to your $PATH.

See INSTALL for full building and installation instructions and details.

Building with HTSlib plug-in support
====================================

Enabling plug-ins causes some parts of HTSlib to be built as separate modules.
There are two advantages to this:

 * The static library libhts.a has fewer dependencies, which makes linking
   third-party code against it easier.

 * It is possible to build extra plug-ins in addition to the ones that are
   bundled with HTSlib.  For example, the hts-plugins repository
   <https://github.com/samtools/htslib-plugins> includes a module that
   allows direct access to files stored in an iRODS data management
   repository (see <https://irods.org/>).

To build with plug-ins, you need to use the --enable-plugins configure option
as follows:

    cd .../samtools-1.17 # Within the unpacked release directory
    ./configure --enable-plugins --prefix=/path/to/location
    make all all-htslib
    make install install-htslib

There are two other configure options that affect plug-ins.  These are:
   --with-plugin-dir=DIR     plug-in installation location
   --with-plugin-path=PATH   default plug-in search path

The default for --with-plugin-dir is <prefix>/libexec/htslib.
--with-plugin-path sets the built-in search path used to find the plug-ins.  By
default this is the directory set by the --with-plugin-dir option.  Multiple
directories should be separated by colons.

Setting --with-plugin-path is useful if you want to run directly from
the source distribution instead of installing the package.  In that case
you can use:

    cd .../samtools-1.17 # Within the unpacked release directory
    ./configure --enable-plugins --with-plugin-path=$PWD/htslib-1.17
    make all all-htslib

It is possible to override the built-in search path using the HTS_PATH
environment variable.  Directories should be separated by colons.  To
include the built-in path, add an empty entry to HTS_PATH:

   export HTS_PATH=:/my/path            # Search built-in path first
   export HTS_PATH=/my/path:            # Search built-in path last
   export HTS_PATH=/my/path1::/my/path2 # Search built-in path between others

Using an optimised zlib library
===============================

Samtools has been minimally tested against both the Intel-optimised and
CloudFlare-optimised zlibs and shown to work.

They can be downloaded from:

    https://github.com/jtkukunas/zlib     # Intel
    https://github.com/cloudflare/zlib    # CloudFlare

Neither Samtools nor HTSlib needs recompiling to use these optimised libraries,
but the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable should be set to a directory
containing the libz.so.1 file.

Benchmarks comparing the various zlibs are available at:

    http://www.htslib.org/benchmarks/zlib.html

It is recommended that you perform your own rigorous tests for an entire
pipeline if you wish to switch to one of the optimised zlib implementations.
