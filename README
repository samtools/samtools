Samtools implements various utilities for post-processing alignments in the
SAM, BAM, and CRAM formats, including indexing, variant calling (in conjunction
with bcftools), and a simple alignment viewer.


Building samtools
=================

The typical simple case of building Samtools using the HTSlib bundled within
this Samtools release tarball is done as follows:

    cd .../samtools-1.6 # Within the unpacked release directory
    ./configure
    make

You may wish to copy the resulting samtools executable into somewhere on your
$PATH, or run it where it is.

Rather than running-in-place like that, the next simplest typical case is to
install samtools etc properly into a directory of your choosing.  Building for
installation using the HTSlib bundled within this Samtools release tarball,
and building the various HTSlib utilities such as bgzip is done as follows:

    cd .../samtools-1.6 # Within the unpacked release directory
    ./configure --prefix=/path/to/location
    make all all-htslib
    make install install-htslib

You will likely wish to add /path/to/location/bin to your $PATH.

See INSTALL for full building and installation instructions and details.


Using an optimised zlib library
===============================

Samtools has been minimally tested against both the Intel-optimised and
CloudFlare-optimised zlibs and shown to work.

They can be downloaded from:

    https://github.com/jtkukunas/zlib     # Intel
    https://github.com/cloudflare/zlib    # CloudFlare

Neither Samtools nor HTSlib needs recompiling to use these optimised libraries,
but the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable should be set to a directory
containing the libz.so.1 file.

Benchmarks comparing the various zlibs are available at:

    http://www.htslib.org/benchmarks/zlib.html

It is recommended that you perform your own rigorous tests for an entire
pipeline if you wish to switch to one of the optimised zlib implementations.
